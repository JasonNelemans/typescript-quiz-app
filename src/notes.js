/* 

In this project I added the font link to the index.html head by importing it from Google fonts. 

In this project I used createGlobalStyles from styled-components. Look at how I render a background 
image and what CSS properties I use for the global styles. 
I import the GlobalStyles component in App.tsx and just render it at the top of the return value. 

> p CSS selector selects all the p tags inside that div/styled component, and nothing outside of it.
